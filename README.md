## Acknowledgement
The set-up of this project was copied from [hello-world-angular](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit-samples/tree/main/frameworks/hello-world-angular) sample of the [Webview UI Toolkit Sample Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) GitHub repository.

The VSCode Guide [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) was a very instructive starting point for the development of a VSCode Webview extension.
